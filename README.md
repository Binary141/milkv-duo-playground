# What is this repo?
Simply a repo that I am using to play around with lower level programming of the Milk-V Duo board from MilkV. [Here](https://milkv.io/docs/duo/overview) are the docs overview of the board. Primarilly all of what I have done can be derived from the overview, the provided toolchain from MilkV, and the [CPU design documentation](https://github.com/sophgo/sophgo-doc/releases)


# Why?
I am interested in playing around with micro controllers and want to learn more about embedded software. No rhyme or reason as to what is put here other than my own curiosity and documentation

[Toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain/blob/master/README.md)
